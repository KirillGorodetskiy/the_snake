# the_snake  
A Snake game built using (insert tech — e.g., Python + Pygame OR JavaScript + Canvas) — part of the Back-End Developer course.

## Description  
This project is a fun interactive game where the player controls a snake to eat items and grow longer, avoiding collisions. It showcases logic for game loop, rendering, user input, and state management. The project is designed as an educational exercise in programming and application structure.

## Features  
- Classic “Snake” gameplay: move, eat, grow, avoid walls/self  
- Use of (tech stack here) for rendering and processing  
- Score tracking and game over condition  
- Clean, easy-to-extend code structure  
- Built for learning and demonstrating application fundamentals
